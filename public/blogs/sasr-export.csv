"The authors used a nonexperimental comparison-group analysis to estimate the effects of the QACF.

"The author used a nonexperimental design called a difference-in-differences study design to test the impact of collective bargaining policies on public sector employee wages.

However, it is still possible for other factors to explain the difference between the treatment and comparison groups. For example, it is possible that the 2007–2009 recession led some states to enact more restrictive laws against collective bargaining and that the recession, rather than impacts of collective bargaining, led to decreases in public sector employees’ wages.  ",,,,"Absence of conflict of interest.",,,"Causal Impact Analysis",,"Compensation and Workplace Conditions, Wages and Benefits, Other wages and benefits",,"Earnings and wages","In the 1960s public sector workers were granted the right to unionize and enter into collective bargaining agreements.

"The authors used a difference-in-difference design to estimate the impacts of ACA’s expansions of health insurance coverage on self-employment among workers 60-69 years of age. The study focuses on older adults because the impact of ACA is likely strongest for this population since average healthcare costs and insurance premiums were higher for them prior to the implementation of ACA. Using data from the American Community Survey (ACS), the authors compared self-employment outcomes among older adults not yet eligible for Medicare (ages 60 to 64) and slightly older adults eligible for Medicare (ages 65 to 69) in the nine years before and three years after the implementation of the ACA's main provisions in 2014. The authors used Medicare-eligible adults as the comparison group since access to health insurance for this group was not tied to employment and therefore less affected by ACA’s expansions of non-employer health insurance.

The study found that the main provisions of the ACA increased incorporated self-employment by 0.35 percentage points, approximately a 6.6 percent increase relative to the mean of 5.3 percent.

Worksites were randomly assigned to treatment and comparison groups in a 2:1 ratio within for profit and nonprofit employers. Approximately the first 20 interested employees at each worksite were enrolled into the study.  
The sample included 12 worksites in the Greater Boston Area. The treatment group consisted of 8 worksites and 163 employees of 4 universities, 3 for-profit-companies, and 1 nonprofit. The comparison group consisted of 4 worksites and 77 employees of 1 university, 2 for-profit companies, and 1 nonprofit. The sample was primarily female (58 percent), White (78 percent), and well-educated (84 percent held a college degree), with an average age of 46 years old.  Most participants did not have health problems that impacted physical ability. 
The treatment group received the intervention. The comparison group was waitlisted for the intervention and were eligible to receive the intervention 6 months after the treatment group.  
The authors used a statistical model to compare the outcomes of treatment and control group members. The study used self-reported measures collected through a standardized health questionnaire.  All data was collected as part of the study at baseline prior to randomization, and 6 months after a worksite received the intervention. For the health survey outcomes, the study used cut points that determined the percentage of participants who scored in the highest level of each outcome. ","Health and safety  


The study found that those assigned to the treatment group were more likely to have reported a higher score for their general health (0.18 percentage points), mental health (0.2 percentage points), role limitations due to physical problems (0.1 percentage points), and social functioning (0.13 percentage points) compared with the control group. These findings were statistically significant. 


The study did not find any statistically significant impacts of the employee well-being program on physical functioning or role limitations due to emotional problems. ","The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to health and safety.

"The study used a nonexperimental design to estimate the impact of collective bargaining laws on the wage differential between public- and private-sector workers. The authors develop the treatment and comparison groups by identifying commuting zones that cross state borders, where one of the bordering states permits collective bargaining and the other prohibits it. Within these commuting zones, study authors then compare the wage differential between public and private sector workers for those in the state permitting collective bargaining (the treatment group) to the corresponding differential in the non-collective bargaining state (the comparison group).  
The study sample includes workers between the ages of 18 to 64 who worked full-time (30-70 hours per week) for at least 50 weeks in the prior 12 months.  For preferred analyses, the sample includes 370,079 workers who work in commuting zones that cross state borders.  
The primary data source used is the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) from the 2005 to 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS collects detailed demographic and labor information on workers, including wages, number of weeks worked, years of education attainment, and workplace location. Study authors supplemented this data with information on state collective bargaining laws from prior research conducted under a separate study (Sanes and Schmitt 2014). There were 21 such commuting zones included in the study.  The authors use a statistical model to compare wages in states that permit collective bargaining to wages in states that prohibit collective bargaining.  Study authors focus on comparing how collective bargaining laws impact the wage differential between similar public and private sector workers in the same local labor markets. ","Earnings and Wages

Across the U.S., the rights of public sector workers to collectively bargain with state and local governments over wages and compensation varies substantially. Some states have laws that allow for collective bargaining, while others explicitly prohibit this practice. 
This study classified states based on the level of restrictions they have imposed on public sector employees’ ability to enter into or opt out of collective bargaining agreements. In states that require collective bargaining, state and local governments must negotiate with public employees in good faith if those employees form a union and seek to collectively bargain. In states that prohibit collective bargaining, state laws explicitly or implicitly forbid state and local governments from negotiating with public sector unions.","The study’s objective was to examine the impact of collective bargaining for public sector workers on hourly earnings and wages. 




The authors used a nonexperimental design to compare the wages of public sector workers living in states where collective bargaining is permitted and states where it is not, using data from the 2005 to 2015 American Community Survey (ACS).

"This study was a randomized controlled trial. Youth were eligible to participate if they were between the ages of 18 through 24 and had been in the custody of the State of Tennessee children's services agency for at least one year after age 14 and/or for at least one day after age 17. During the study enrollment period from October 2010 to October 2012, 1,322 youth were identified as eligible; 534 of these participants were randomly assigned to receive the YVLifeSet program and 788 were assigned to the control condition. Those in the control group did not receive services from YVLifeSet but were given a list of other social services and resources that were available in the community.  
The primary data sources were a background survey administered at enrollment, service participation data from the program's management information system, a follow-up survey conducted 12 months after the enrollment, and administrative data from the National Student Clearinghouse to determine college enrollment. The background survey collected data on participants' demographics, employment and educational history, receipt of mental health and substance use treatment, involvement with the criminal justice system, and contact with parents and relatives. The follow-up survey collected data on key outcomes including educational and employment attainment, earnings, housing stability, social support, health and safety, and criminal involvement. The follow-up survey was administered to 1,114 participants (659 from the control group and 455 of the treatment) while administrative data from the NSC was available for all participants.   
The authors used a statistical model to compare the outcomes of treatment and control group members. This statistical model included controls for participants' baseline characteristics. 
Seventy-two percent of participants were 18 years old at the time of enrollment and the sample was about half female (48 percent). The ethnic and racial composition of the study sample included 52 percent non-Hispanic White, 38 percent non-Hispanic Black, 6 percent non-Hispanic other race, and 5 percent Hispanic.

The authors also note that while response rates for the follow-up survey were reasonably high and similar between the treatment and comparison group, participants who could not be located or reached by intake staff to complete services and the follow-up survey could possibly have been more transient, unstable, or less motivated. For those reasons, the evaluation sample may have represented a somewhat higher-functioning group, on average, and findings about the YVLifeSet program may not be generalizable to the population of transition-age youth from the child welfare and juvenile justice systems. ",,,,"Absence of conflict of interest.","Educational services, Health care and social assistance","United States","Causal Impact Analysis","Youth, Justice-involved, Other barriers, Disconnected youth","Employment and Training Services, Employment and Reemployment, Youth programs","Earnings and wages-Mod/high-Favorable impacts, Education and skills gains-Low-No impacts, Employment-Mod/high-Favorable impacts, Public benefits receipt-Mod/high-Favorable impacts, Training-Low-No impacts","Earnings and wages, Education and skills gains, Employment, Public benefits receipt, Training","Since the 1980s, the federal government has encouraged and supported states in providing programs to prepare youth in foster care for independent living as adults.

Study participants were sixty employees who were recruited from a single Ohio-based digital marketing firm. Participants were between the ages of 21-57, and the sample was predominantly female (67%) and white (95%). Before eligible participants were assigned to the different conditions, they were asked to assess their perceived stress and to measure their stress, coping, and affect over the course of three days, after which they participated in a four-hour mindfulness workshop. Following the workshop, half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive an additional mindfulness intervention for a six-week period. The additional intervention consisted of six weeks of access to an online didactic video series further describing the United Mindfulness System. This group was also asked to complete daily home practice sessions and participate in weekly group conference calls. Participants in the higher dosage condition could optionally receive a 15-minute phone meeting with the mindfulness instructor.  In total, 29 participants were assigned to the low-dosage mindfulness intervention, and 31 were assigned to the high-dosage mindfulness intervention. After the six-week intervention period concluded, participants completed three days of ecological momentary assessments and a questionnaire battery. The two intervention groups were then compared to one another.  
This study measured participants’ perceived stress, coping, and affect. Perceived stress was measured using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). In addition, participants completed brief assessments measuring stress, coping, and affect.  The brief assessments were collected four times daily for three days before and after the intervention period.

Under the ACA, states had the opportunity to elect to expand public insurance through Medicaid. By 2015, a total of 28 states and the District of Columbia had elected to expand eligibility for Medicaid. The ACA included provisions to reduce the risk of crowd out, that is, individuals changing from private to public insurance coverage.

"The study is an interrupted time series analysis: participants were observed quarterly for one year. Participant data was collected at admission (baseline) and then after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The number of data points for individuals varies because some participants dropped out or were discharged from the program, and others did not have data for a full year because they entered the study toward the end of the study period.  
The initial sample is 779 individuals ages 16-30 in urban and suburban areas of New York who had experienced psychosis for at least one week but less than two years. Six months into the study (i.e., at the time of Q2 outcomes), 458 individuals were remaining in the sample. At the 9- and 12-month measurement periods (Q3 and Q4), the sample sizes were 355 and 283 participants, respectively.

Among the baseline sample, 74% of the participants were male, 27% were White, non-Hispanic, 36% were black, non-Hispanic, and 27% were Hispanic. Among all the participants, 28% had not completed high school; 19% had a high school diploma or GED; 41% had some college; and 12% had finished college. Almost all of the participants had been prescribed antipsychotic medication.  
During treatment period, the participants were deemed as receiving the treatment by meeting with the supported SEE specialist (not counting team meetings or brief introductions), in a given quarter. For each meeting, the purpose was categorized as focused on employment, education, or both. For analyses of the eligible outcome, employment, the focus of the meeting must have been employment only. The comparison condition is not meeting with the SEE specialist to discuss employment only during a particular quarter.  
The authors use a statistical model to examine the association between using SEE services for employment only in one quarter and employment in the subsequent quarter, i.e., using SEE services for employment only in quarter 1 and being employed in quarter 2, using SEE services for employment only in quarter 2 and being employed in quarter 3, and using SEE services for employment only in quarter 3 and being employed in quarter 4. Since the number of individuals included in the sample decreased each quarter, the sample size for each model varies.

"The study is a randomized control trial that assigned 799 participants receiving MFIP employment services to the MSTED treatment group (n=403) or to a control group receiving MFIP services as usual (n=396). At the start of the study in November 2014, participants had to (1) have received MFIP benefits for at least six months, (2) have earned $1,200 or less in that time, (3) be currently unemployed, (4) not be minors who were parents, (5) not be parents between ages 18 and 24 who were in a full-time education program, and (6) not be exempt from MFIP work requirements. In mid-2015, due to an improving economy and fewer than expected referrals, eligibility for MSTED was expanded to any unemployed individual who was receiving MFIP benefits, was not pursuing a full-time education program, and was not exempt from work activity requirements. On average, study participants were approximately 30 years old, female (82%), and never married (75%). MSTED was implemented by three nonprofit organizations in three counties in Minnesota including Ramsey County, Dakota County, and Hennepin County. Each county contracted with one or two MSTED providers.  
Data sources used in the study include staff and participant interviews, surveys, case reviews, and administrative data. Administrative data sources include Workforce One and MAXIS, the Minnesota Department of Health and Human Services data systems; payment records from MSTED providers; the National Directory of New Hires; and state administrative data. Participants also provided survey data in the form of a baseline information questionnaire and a 12-month follow-up survey.  The authors use a statistical model to compare the outcomes of treatment and control group members.  ","Administrative data on employment  


After one year, participants who had access to MSTED services were significantly more likely to be employed (86.9%) compared to participants in the control group (80.2%) and were significantly more likely to be employed in all quarters (36.1%) compared to participants in the control group (29.3%). 


During the first quarter of the second year, the study found no statistically significant relationship between access to MSTED services and employment.

The study found no statistically significant relationship between access to MSTED services and total earnings after one year. 


Survey data on earnings 


The study found no statistically significant relationship between access to MSTED services and earning more than $15 per hour in a current job.

The study found no statistically significant relationship between access to MSTED services and receiving a high school diploma or equivalent certificate or earning a professional license or certification.  ","The authors conducted a randomized control trial; however, the outcomes based on survey data had high levels of attrition. Additionally, although the authors controlled for some demographic characteristics of participants, they did not specify whether they accounted for pre-intervention differences on measures related to the outcome domains. The review protocol requires that analyses of employment-related outcomes must include controls for previous employment or earnings from at least one year before program participation, that education-related outcomes should control for baseline education level and socioeconomic status, that earnings-related outcomes control for previous earnings at least one year before program participation, and that public benefits receipt-related outcomes control for public benefit receipt or socioeconomic status. The authors did not note if they included these control variables, so preexisting differences between the groups—and not MSTED— could explain the observed differences in outcomes. Therefore, the survey outcomes are not eligible for a high causal evidence rating, the highest rating available for experimental designs. 
The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment, earnings, education and skill gains, and public benefit receipt. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness.

Wisconsin PROMISE enrolled 2,024 teenagers receiving SSI from a list of eligible youth (from the Social Security Administration). Of those enrolled in the study, 1,018 were randomly assigned to the Wisconsin PROMISE group and 1,006 continued services as usual. The services as usual group received information about Wisconsin’s usual transition services. 
All participants had a documented disability of some type. One-third (34 percent) of treatment group participants self-reported a mental health or behavioral primary disability, 30 percent reported a developmental or intellectual primary disability, 25 percent reported some other kind of primary disability (e.g., learning, speech, ADHD, etc.), and 11 percent reported a physical disability (e.g. long-term illness, mobility, sensory, head injury, etc.). Nearly half (49 percent) of treatment youth were African American, 36 percent were white, and 10 percent were Hispanic. The treatment group was also predominantly male (67 percent), and two-thirds of participants were living in a single parent/guardian household. The majority (70 percent) of treatment families reported an annual household income at or below $25,000. Eighty-four percent of treatment youth had an Individualized Education Plan at the time of their enrollment.  
The study drew on a variety of data sources, including service data (benefit specialist contacts and service hours, work incentives, family advocate activities, case notes, etc.), administrative data from the PROMISE management information system (MIS) (case note tags, list of participant family members, service completion dates, educational attainment, etc.), engagement/service completion data, employment data (Wisconsin UI wage data), and educational attainment data from the National Student Clearinghouse (post-secondary enrollment and attainment).

Because WIOA services were available to both the treatment and control group, the authors suggest that it may have reduced the overall impact of PROMISE by improving usual services. In addition, the authors note that, prior to PROMISE, the service system more typically served adults. It took some time for PROMISE service providers to adjust to serving a younger population, which also may have weakened the impact of the intervention. They suggest that further data collection over a longer time period is needed to confirm the long-term impacts of PROMISE on education, employment, and financial self-sufficiency.

PROMISE counselors received training in motivational interviewing and trauma-informed care. Services included educational, employment, and financial self-sufficiency services and supports such as self-advocacy training, social skills training, paid work experiences, work incentive benefits counseling, and financial coaching. Family members of enrolled youth could receive similar services through a Family Service Plan (FSP) connected to the youth's service record. ","The study's objective was to examine the impact of Wisconsin PROMISE (Promoting the Readiness of Minors in Supplemental Security Income) on youth employment, earnings and wages, and education and skills gains among youth with disabilities receiving supplemental security income (SSI) benefits.  


This study was a randomized controlled trial. The study drew on a variety of data sources, including service data, administrative data from the PROMISE management information system (MIS), engagement/service completion data, employment data, and educational attainment data. The authors compared the outcomes of PROMISE-enrolled youth to those of the comparison group. 


Youth who received PROMISE services had higher employment rates (10 percentage points higher) than those in the control group. There were no differences between groups in terms of the proportion earning SGA-equivalent wages for at least one quarter, or in terms of post-secondary enrollment.

The  Business and Industry (B&I) Guaranteed Loan program is the oldest and largest program operated under RBS. The B&I program aims to stimulate rural economies and create employment opportunities through loan guarantees for business and infrastructure development. By reducing lender risk through loan guarantees, the program also aims to encourage lenders to approve larger loans or loans they would not otherwise make to rural businesses. The program has grown over the last 30 years, and currently supports an average of 400 new loans and over $1 billion in obligated loan amounts each year. 

The B&I program is a lender-driven loan guarantee program which guarantees a percentage of the principal loan if the rural business borrower defaults on the loan. The guaranteed amount varies depending on the total principal of the loan: loans of $5 million or less have a maximum guarantee rate of 80%; loans from $5 to 10 million have a maximum guarantee rate of 70%; loans from $10–25 million have a maximum guarantee rate of 60%. The guaranteed portion of the loan does not count against legal lending limits. The B&I program is available to most national and state-chartered banks, thefts, Community Development Institutions (CDFI), community development corporations, mortgage companies, and insurance companies. Lenders first apply to participate in the B&I program through their state's USDA Rural Development Business Program Director. Approved lenders and borrowers then agree on loan terms, and apply for guaranteed loans through their local USDA office. Borrowers must be located in a rural areas. For each guaranteed loan, the USDA charges an initial fee of 3% of the loan amount, and an annual renewal fee based on the outstanding principal loan balance. Business borrowers can use the funding received through guaranteed loans for business acquisitions, debt refinancing, or to purchase land, buildings, machinery or requirement.

"The study uses an instrumental variables design where OSHA inspections are an instrument for plant-level workplace risks. This instrumental variables design is combined with a difference-in-differences (DID) approach to compare fatality rates and the resulting effects on wages between inspected plants versus uninspected plants. The models control for time-varying plant characteristics like number of employees and turnover, and the preferred models contain fixed effects for year, plant, industry, and the three-way interaction of year, industry, and state.  

The study uses OSHA inspection records, which include plant injury and fatality rates, and data on plant-level employment and wages from the Census of Manufactures and Annual Survey of Manufactures. Matching the OSHA inspection data with the Census of Manufactures requires an iterative process, including manual matching to achieve the best matching rates. The authors conducted the necessary manual matching for seven industries with high fatality rates; these seven industries are the focus of the authors’ main analyses.  

The main analyses use data from 1987 to 1997 and focus on plants that receive their first OSHA inspection between 1988 and 1996, thus having at least one observation prior to and one observation after the first inspection. The analytic sample includes 28,071 plants and 112,865 observations across the time period. The treatment condition is manufacturing plants that received an OSHA inspection.

"The study was a randomized control trial with 308 social work and nursing students at one northeastern college in the U.S. that received a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) SBIRT Health Professions training grant. Students were randomly assigned to treatment as usual (TAU) or the treatment of TAU plus access to OPS. Treatment as usual consisted of 40 minutes of introductory pre-training videos and 1.5 hours of in-person instruction and role-plays on SBIRT. Participants were predominately female (85%) and white (77%) social work and nursing students, with an average age of 26. The authors compared the outcomes of TAU and intervention students (OPS) using self-reported survey data collected in person and online through the SBIRT Attitudes, Self-Perception of Skills, and Knowledge Survey (AKS). TAU and OPS students were compared on composite AKS scores and along the sub-domains of confidence, importance, and attitudes at pre-training, post-training, and 30 days post-training.  ","Attitudes 


	
	The study found no statistically significant differences between OPS and TAU groups on composite AKS scores or sub-domain (confidence, importance, and attitudes) scores from pre-training to post-training, from pre-training to 30 days post-training, or from post-training to 30 days post-training.  
	
	
	However, the study suggested those who received OPS showed improved composite AKS scores at each stage: pre to post-training, pre-training to 30 days post-training and post-training to 30 days post-training. 
	
	
	The study also suggested there was improvement among those who received OPS within each subdomain between pre-training and post-training and between each domain except for confidence between post-training and 30 days post-training.  ","The authors did not account for preexisting differences between the groups before program participation or include sufficient control variables. These preexisting differences between the groups—and not OPS—could explain the observed differences in outcomes. The authors also did not provide enough information about the statistical models to fully understand their results. Therefore, the study is not eligible for a high causal evidence rating, the highest rating available for experimental designs. 

The authors note that there was limited intervention uptake: the majority of intervention students (80%) who had access to OPS did not end up utilizing it, and only 56% of those who used it did so more than once. This practice may have contributed to the lack of statistically significant findings. The authors also note that the lack of findings could also be due to a strong treatment as usual condition, making the OPS intervention ineffective on the skills of students on its own. Further, the study sample was limited to participants from one college, and therefore the results may not be generalizable.  ",,,,"Absence of conflict of interest. ","Educational services","United States","Causal Impact Analysis","Health professional","Employment and Training Services, Training and Education, Community college education and other classroom training","Attitudes-Low-No impacts",,"Frontline healthcare professionals and social workers often do not receive adequate training in substance use prevention and treatment, particularly in evidenced-based interventions.

"The study used a quasi-experimental prospective switching replications design, with some groups receiving training at an earlier phase (the treatment group) and some at a later phase (the comparison group). A total of 20 construction companies were recruited from three regions in the U.S. to participate in the study. The companies in each location were randomly assigned to either the early intervention group or lagged-control group. There were 169 leaders and 809 workers recruited in the early intervention group, and 117 leaders and 364 workers in the lagged-control group.  

Both groups completed pretests, then the early group was given the training and both groups completed another survey (wave 1). After that, the comparison group received the training while the early group served as the control group (wave 2). Leaders in the early intervention group completed surveys immediately before and after the training, and two weeks and four weeks after completing the training. Leaders in the lagged-control group completed surveys four weeks prior to, immediately before and after the training, as well as two weeks after training. However, not all waves were used in the analysis.  To test the effect of the training (hypothesis 1 and 2), the study compared the early group to the lagged-control group in wave 1. To test the post-training effects at four weeks compared to two weeks after the training, the post-training data from the early intervention group was analyzed, with no comparison group. 

Participants were primary white males, with the average age between 38 and 45 years.  ","The study found that the leaders showed increased use of safety practices two weeks after participating in the training. 
	
	
	There was no statistically significant effect on leaders’ crew-reporting safety-related conditions. 
	
	
	There was no significant change in the worker-reported outcomes or post training outcome improvement in the workers’ data. ","Several considerations should inform the interpretation of findings. First, although the authors examined the outcomes measures before the training and no significant difference were found on the pretest measures, the study did not check for differences in age between the two groups, nor was age included in the analysis model. Second, it is likely that the sample members could have anticipated the intervention and changed their safety leadership or behaviors prior to participating in the training; this is not addressed in the research design.  

Third, the study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to the domain of Health and Safety: leaders’ use of safety practices, leaders’ crews’ reporting of safety-related conditions, worker-reported safety climate, worker-reported safety practices, and worker-reported safety-related conditions. The study design did not adjust for multiple comparisons. Fourth, the unit of assignment was an entire company, such that leaders were nested within companies, and workers were nested within leaders, but the analysis did not account for the nesting effects. 

Finally, in comparing four week post-intervention outcomes to two week post-intervention outcomes for the early intervention group, the design did not account for the possibility of increasing or decreasing trends in the outcomes prior to enrollment in the program. That is, if participants who had increasing trends before the intervention got enrolled in the program, we would anticipate further increases over time, even if they did not participate in the program. Without knowing the trends before program enrollment (by observing outcomes at multiple time points prior to enrollment), we cannot rule this out.   ",,,,"Absence of conflict of interest.","Construction, Small business, Large business","United States","Causal Impact Analysis","Adult, Employed","Compensation and Workplace Conditions, Health and Safety, Other health and safety","Health and safety-Low-Favorable impacts",,"The intervention was delivered as a 2.5-hour training course designed to improve the job safety practices of construction industry workers.

"This study is a follow-up impact study based on an earlier RCT study, in which students were randomly selected to enroll in an EC by lottery. In the original study, the treatment group consisted of students enrolled in an EC, which provided dual high school/college enrollment. The comparison group consisted of students attending a traditional high school without dual enrollment. The original study consisted of students at 10 Early Colleges located in the following states: North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. All were small schools. 

The current study collected data six years after students participating in the initial study graduated from high school. To be eligible for the retrospective impact study, each EC had to meet the following criteria: (1) it included students in grades 9–12, (2) it had students completing high school by 2011, (3) it conducted admission lotteries for at least one of the three incoming student cohorts who participated in the original study, (4) it retained its records from the lottery, and (5) it implemented ECHSI across the school. Eight ECs were eligible for the follow-up study. 

Approximately half of the students in the study were female, and about half were non-white. Additionally, about half the population was low-income, which was determined by eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch. Less than one-fourth of the students had parents who did not go to college. Also, all students who participated in the EC lottery had math and English Language Arts (ELA) scores that were above the state average.  

Data for two primary outcomes were collected: college enrollment and postsecondary degree attainment, using the Student Tracker Service at the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC). For college enrollment, data was collected within six years of expected high school graduation, including 2-year or 4-year post-secondary programs. The authors used a statistical model to compare college enrollment and postsecondary degree completion between students enrolled in the ECs and the control group, who were enrolled in traditional high schools without dual enrollment. The main impact analyses used an intent-to-treat (ITT) sample, which estimated the impact of being assigned to an EC through a lottery, regardless of whether students later enrolled in the EC. The analysis model accounted for the clustering of students within lotteries. ","Education and Skills Gains 


	
	The study found that participating in an EC program had a statistically significant positive impact on postsecondary enrollment compared to enrollment in traditional high schools without an EC program. Students participating in the EC program demonstrated higher rates of college attendance four to six years after expected high school graduation and higher rates of attendance at two-year colleges than students that did not participate in an EC program. Over time, the two groups exhibited similar rates of four-year college attendance.    
	
	
	The study also found that participating in an EC program had a statistically significant positive impact on receiving a postsecondary degree compared to students not participating in an EC program. EC students were significantly more likely to receive an Associate’s degree or certificate program and a Bachelor’s degree each year four to six years after expected high school graduation than students not participating in an EC program.  ","This was a well-implemented RCT study; however, the authors note that the study's results cannot be applied to ECs that do not use lotteries and lowers the generalizability of the study.

ILS participation was measured using administrative data from the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD), which includes service receipt for ILS funded through CFCIP and outcomes for foster care youth transitioning to adulthood. Youth were considered to have received ILS if they received any of the following services: academic support, such as GED preparation, academic counseling, tutoring, or assistance with coursework or homework; career preparation, such as job placement support, career coaching, or vocational assessment services;  employment or vocational programs, such as internships or job training programs; mentoring; or education financial assistance including monetary assistance for educational/vocational supplies.

"This study used a difference-in-differences analysis to compare rates of employment and SNAP participation before and after the reinstatement of work requirements for ABADWs. Intervention and comparison conditions were constructed using the staggered reinstatement of SNAP work requirements across the period 2011 to 2017. Individuals experiencing the treatment condition were those observed in states where SNAP work requirements were reinstated. Individuals in the comparison condition were those observed in states where SNAP work requirements were not reinstated. Results were estimated using a statistical model that controlled for individual demographic characteristics, county-level labor market characteristics, and state-level political characteristics.  

The study used individual-level data from the American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) across the period 2010 to 2017. SNAP Quality Control (QC) Data were used to reweight the ACS data to generate a sample that more accurately reflected the characteristics of SNAP participants. The analysis sample was restricted to prime working-age individuals, aged 25 to 49, who were U.S. citizens residing in the continental United States, and who were not institutionalized, students, active-duty military, or in foster care.

"The study compared the retirement probabilities, expected age of retirement, and expected age of Social Security claiming between two cohorts, only one of which was impacted by the implementation of the ACA. The data come from two cohorts in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS): Early Boomers, who were born between 1948 and 1953, and Mid Boomers, who were born between 1953 and 1959. The study examines the probability of retiring by 2008 (for Early Boomers) or 2014 (for Mid Boomers) among those who were employed when they were first interviewed (2004 for Early Boomers or 2010 for Mid Boomers). The study also examines change in the expected Social Security benefit claiming or retirement age for those who reported their expectations in the initial and final survey years (2004 and 2008 for the Early Boomers and 2010 and 2014 for the Mid Boomers). For each analysis, the authors compare any changes found between cohorts. The authors argue that the group of individuals most likely to change their retirement behavior due to the ACA are those with employer-provided health insurance that will not continue coverage if the individual retires prior to the age of 65. For this reason, the authors conduct their analysis among three groups--employer provided health insurance when working only, employer provided health insurance on the job and in retirement, and no employer provided health insurance—focusing primarily on the first of these groups.  The sample varies by outcomes, with a sample size ranging from 1,344 individuals to 3,939.  ","Employment

"The study used a difference-in-differences design to compare outcomes for individuals in states that expanded Medicaid access to those of individuals in states that did not expand access, while also comparing outcomes for other individuals in the same states at earlier points in time. Data on state-level Medicaid-eligibility criteria come from the Henry Kaiser Family Foundation. All other data come from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and its associated Annual Social and Economic Supplement. The CPS is a monthly survey of about 60,000 households. Each sampled household is interviewed monthly for four months, not interviewed for eight months, and then interviewed again for four months. Accordingly, each household’s total participation in the CPS spans a period of 16 months. Because of the CPS’s format, the study’s analysis relies on a changing sample of individuals prior to and after Medicaid expansion.  

The study examined individuals ages 16-64 who were first interviewed between January 2009 and April 2016 and whose household income would potentially meet the Medicaid eligibility criteria. One analysis focused on individuals who worked part-time at any point at which they were interviewed while another analysis focused on individuals who worked full-time when they were first interviewed but later reported working part-time due to health issues. For the first analysis, the analytic sample was 3,335 people in non-expansion states and 4,949 people in expansion states. For the second analysis, the analytic sample was 166 people in non-expansion states and 245 people in expansion states. Among the larger sample used in the first analysis, the average age of participants was around 39 years old, about 58-60 percent identified as women, and about 47-55 percent identified as non-Hispanic White.

The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to employment. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests in the Employment Domain, so the number of statistically significant findings in this domain is likely to be overstated. Outcomes in the other domains (Earnings and Wages, Public Benefits Receipt) were adjusted for multiple comparisons, and do not have this same concern. 

The study examined outcomes across multiple Public Housing Authorities, with the authors noting that the implementation of the Rent Reform Demonstration varied across the four PHAs. Of note, Lexington had already introduced a $150 minimum TTP before the demonstration began, so both the new rent policy and existing rent policy group were subject to the same minimum TTP. Furthermore, Washington D.C. did not implement the triennial certification until after the first year of the study. 

These differences in implementation and the existing rent rules also could have impacted the observed outcomes. 

For the purposes of this report, the authors defined the follow-up period as “the period that begins in the month after the month in which the family’s new TTP was expected to take effect” and not from random assignment. A family’s new TTP effective date typically occurred 4 to 6 months after random assignment (in Quarter 3). Thus, Year 1 is defined as Quarters 3-6 after random assignment, and Year 2 is defined as Quarters 7-10 after random assignment.  ",,,,"Absence of conflict of interest.  ",,"Urban, United States","Causal Impact Analysis","Adult, Low income","Employment and Training Services, Employment and Reemployment, Other employment and reemployment","Earnings and wages-Mod/high-Favorable impacts, Employment-Mod/high-Favorable impacts, Public benefits receipt-Mod/high-Favorable impacts",,"The federal Housing Choice Voucher program that provides rental subsidies to low-income families has been criticized for having a disincentive to work (due to policies that increase rent prices as family income rises) and for requiring substantial administrative costs and effort to implement.

The new Rent Reform Demonstration policy updated three main areas of the subsidy program: (1) how total tenant payments and subsidies are calculated, (2) recertification time periods, and (3) safeguards for families. First, the policy simplified how the total tenant payment (TTP) is calculated by basing it on gross income over the past 12 months (rather than adjusted income), ignoring income earned from total family assets less than $25,000, and linking utility allowances to voucher amounts. The new policy also included a $50 to $150 minimum total tenant payment (with amounts varying by location) to mirror a typical landlord-tenant relationship. Second, annual income recertifications were replaced with a triennial recertification to ensure that that earnings gains do not increase TTP for at least two years.

For example, the revised policy included a 6-month grace period to allow families to temporarily reduce their TTP after the triennial recertification if their current or expected income was lower than their income over the prior 12 months and allowed for the family to apply annually for interim recertifications when their income dropped by more than 10 percent.

However, total earnings in Year 1 (Quarters 3-6), Year 2 (Quarters 7-10), Years 1 and 2 combined (Quarters 3-10), and all other individual quarters were not significantly different across the groups. 
	


Public Benefits Receipt  


	
	The study found that significantly more families in the new rent policy group remained in the HCV program than the comparison group (5.1 percent more). 
	
	
	The study did not find any statistically significant effects of the Rent Reform Demonstration on the length of time a household received a housing subsidy.  ","Although the study was a well-implemented randomized controlled trial, there are a few factors that should be considered when interpreting the findings. 

The study authors estimated multiple related impacts on outcomes related to Employment, Earnings, and Public Benefits Receipt. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The authors did not perform statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated. 

Lexington had already introduced a $150 minimum TTP before the demonstration began, with few exemptions permitted. The authors noted that because Lexington continued the policy for both the new rent policy and existing rent policy group, findings only reflect the other features of the new rent rules and not any possible effects of a minimum TTP. 

For the purposes of this report, the authors defined the follow-up period as “the period that begins in the month after the month in which the family’s new TTP was expected to take effect” and not from random assignment. A family’s new TTP effective date typically occurred 4 to 6 months after random assignment (in Quarter 3). Thus, Year 1 is defined as Quarters 3-6 after random assignment, and Year 2 is defined as Quarters 7-10 after random assignment. ",,,,"Absence of conflict of interest.  ",,"Urban, United States","Causal Impact Analysis","Adult, Low income","Employment and Training Services, Employment and Reemployment, Other employment and reemployment","Earnings and wages-Mod/high-Favorable impacts, Employment-Mod/high-No impacts, Public benefits receipt-Mod/high-Favorable impacts",,"The federal Housing Choice Voucher program that provides rental subsidies to low-income families has been criticized for having a disincentive to work (due to policies that increase rent prices as family income rises) and for requiring substantial administrative costs and effort to implement. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched the Rent Reform Demonstration to design and evaluate an alternative rent-subsidy policy for housing choice voucher recipients. 

In Lexington, the new Rent Reform Demonstration policy updated three main areas of the subsidy program: (1) how total tenant payments and subsidies are calculated, (2) recertification time periods, and (3) safeguards for families. First, the policy simplified how the total tenant payment (TTP) is calculated by basing it on gross income over the past 12 months (rather than adjusted income), ignoring income earned from total family assets less than $25,000, and linking utility allowances to voucher amounts. A $150 minimum total tenant payment designed to mirror a typical landlord-tenant relationships was also implemented prior to when the demonstration began and continued to apply as part of the new rent policy. Second, annual income recertifications were replaced with a triennial recertification to ensure that that earnings gains do not increase TTP for at least two years. Finally, the new policy included additional safeguards for families. For example, the revised policy included a 6-month grace period to allow families to temporarily reduce their TTP after the triennial recertification if their current or expected income was lower than their income over the prior 12 months and allowed for the family to apply annually for interim recertifications when their income dropped by more than 10 percent. Additionally, the new policy included a revised hardship policy that allowed TTP reductions under specific conditions (e.g., when facing eviction).  ","The study's objective was to examine the impact of the Rent Reform Demonstration on earnings and employment among families served by the Public Housing Authority (PHA) in Lexington, Kentucky.

	The study was a randomized controlled trial that used PHA administrative data and wage records to compare families receiving housing choice vouchers who were subject to the new Rent Reform Demonstration rules to a comparison group subject to the existing rent rules of their PHA. 
	
	
	In Lexington, KY, the study found that new rent policy group had significantly higher earnings in Quarter 8, and were significantly more likely to remain in the HCV program after 30 months than the existing rent rules group. The study found no statistically significant effects of the new rent policy on employment.  
	
	
	The quality of causal evidence presented in this report is high because it was based on a well-implemented randomized controlled trial.

Furthermore, the study focuses on impacts measured four to six years after the passage of the Telework Enhancement Act, yet the author finds no statistically significant relationship between whether a federal agency is covered under the Act and either the probability that the given federal agency has a teleworking policy or the proportion of agency employees who telework four to six years after the passage of the Act in 2010. The Act is therefore a “weak” instrument for access to teleworking in the timeframe that is the focus of the study: since the Act no longer generated variation in access to teleworking between the “treatment” and “control” agencies by four to six years after the Act’s passage, comparing outcomes between the “treatment” and “control” agencies in this timeframe provides little insight into whether access to teleworking is related to average general schedule grade level.  ",,,,"Absence of conflict of interest. ","Public administration","United States","Causal Impact Analysis",Employed,"Compensation and Workplace Conditions, Wages and Benefits, Other wages and benefits",,Employment,"The 2010 Telework Enhancement Act was implemented with the aim of expanding telework among federal employees. Under the Act, covered agencies were required to establish a telework policy, assign a telework managing officer, identify eligible employees, and inform those eligible of their telework option. The Act applied to executive federal agencies only (those headed by a Cabinet secretary or the Office of the President); non-executive federal agencies (e.g., the Federal Reserve or Securities and Exchange Commision) were not covered but could choose to offer teleworking to their employees. ","The study's objective was to examine the impact of teleworking on job promotions.

Chapter 3: Is the Road to Unemployment Paved with Good Intentions? Labor Market Outcomes of Young Women



The study applied an instrumental variable design to estimate the impact of telework on job promotions, as measured among federal employees by general schedule grade level, using passage of the 2010 Telework Enhancement Act as an instrument for access to telework. The Act required federal executive agencies to provide a telework policy, but did not affect non-executive federal agencies. Using administrative agency-level data on teleworking and the average general schedule grade level, the author compared outcomes for federal employees who worked in agencies that were and were not required to adopt a telework policy under the Act. 

The study suggested there was no clear evidence that teleworking was related to the agency-level average general schedule level, as a measure of job promotions.  


This study receives a low evidence rating because the author reported agency-level results but did not provide information on changes in the composition of employees working in agencies that were and were not affected by the Act. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable only to teleworking; other factors may have have contributed. ","Chang, C.J.

"The study used a randomized control design to examine the impact of the intervention on earnings and benefit in SSDI recipients who experience serious mental health illness.  SSDI recipients that met inclusion criteria and lived within 30 miles of a site were randomly assigned to the treatment group (IPS and other services) or the control group (which could access other services available in the community). 2,160 individuals with psychiatric disorders receiving SSDI benefits were included in the study. 1,062 received the intervention and 1,098 were in the control group. The sample was primarily female (53 percent) and White (62 percent), with an average age of 47 years old and at least a high school degree (62 percent). The primary psychiatric diagnoses were schizophrenia (29 percent) or affective disorder (71 percent). The treatment group received the intervention over a two or three-year period. The comparison group were provided with a list of resources for people with psychiatric disorders and continued with services as usual. Data was collected from SSA’s Master Earning File and Disability Analysis Files. The Master Earnings Files includes earnings information reported annually by employers. The Disability Analysis file includes monthly benefits information from SSDI and SSI administrative data. Baseline demographic data was collected in the original study from 2006 until 2010. Follow-up outcomes used SSA administrative data from 2011 to 2015. The authors conducted generalized linear mixed-effects regression models. The models included time fixed effects, and analyses were adjusted for repeated measures of an individual over time as well as missing data at random.  ","Earnings and Wages The study found that treatment group participants were statistically significantly more likely to have any earnings than the control group (41% vs. 37%).  Participants in the treatment group also had statistically significant total higher earnings than those in the control group; earning $5,073 more, on average, over the follow-up period. Among only those that worked, the treatment group earned on average, $7,468 more than the control group.  In the first year after the intervention ended, the study found that the treatment group was 2.6 times more likely to have any earnings than those in the control group (statistically significant), earning $737 more in the first year. Public benefits receipt The study found no statistically significant effect between the intervention and SSI/SSDI benefits ever suspended or terminated for work; total number of months with SSI/SSDI benefits suspended or terminated for work; the total SSI/SSDI benefits forgone for work; or the total cash payments from SSDI and SSI. ","Participants were enrolled in the study on a rolling basis, so the follow-up time period is not the same for all participants.

"The study used a randomized controlled trial design. The researchers used a lottery-like process to randomly assign 2,622 individuals to one of three groups: the PWE program group (n=874), an OJT program group (n=877), or the control group (n=871). All participants were TANF recipients in Los Angeles County who participated in the county’s welfare-to-work program, but were unable to find unsubsidized jobs during a four-week job club. To be included, participants had to be receiving TANF benefits and have five or more months left of TANF eligibility, must not have participated in Transitional Subsidized Employment in the preceding 12 months, and must have been able to work the required hours and have no major identified barriers that would prevent them from working. 

Of the full sample, most (85.5%) of study participants were female, and more than 80% were non-White (55% Hispanic/Latino; 32% Black, non-Hispanic; 3% Asian, non-Hispanic). 39% of participants lacked a high school diploma or an equivalent credential. On average, participants were 31.7 years old.    

Participants assigned to the OJT group were referred to a Worksource Center to be placed into the corresponding type of subsidized job. Like those in the control group, they could still continue to receive TANF benefits, as well as other TANF welfare-to-work services and community services. Of those randomized to the OJT group, 42 percent were placed in subsidized employment. On average, OJT placements were made in 33 days and lasted about 84 days.  Individuals in the control group were not placed into the subsidized job, but they could still receive TANF benefits, other TANF welfare-to-work services and community services.  

The impact analysis uses administrative data and survey data. Administrative data included quarterly wage data from the National Directory of New Hires and TANF and food stamp payment records from the Los Angeles Department of Public Social Services.  Survey data were collected from the full study sample at approximately 30 months after random assignment, including information about employment, education, training, and personal and economic well-being. The authors used a statistical model to compare the outcomes of those in OJT to those in the control group, accounting for initial characteristics.  ","Employment 


	
	OJT participants were more likely to have been employed during the first year of follow-up than control group participants (18.3 percentage points according to administrative data, 14.5 percentage points according to survey data), but no more likely to be employed during the last year of follow-up.  
	



	
	OJT participants were 5.4 percentage points more likely to be currently employed than control group members at the time of the 12-month survey, but were no more likely to be currently employed at the time of the 30-month survey. 
	
	
	OJT participants were employed for 0.6 more quarters, on average, than control group participants during the first year of follow-up, but there were no such differences in the last year of follow-up.

	OJT participants had a total income $1,084 more in the first year of follow-up than control group participants, but their total income was no greater in the last year of follow-up.  
	



	
	OJT participants were no more likely to have received income from working in the month prior to the 30-month survey, or to be earning greater than $12.00 or greater than $15.00 per hour at that time. 
	


Education and skills gains 


	
	Compared to those in the control group, participants receiving OJT were no more likely to be participating in postsecondary education at the time of the 30-month survey.  
	
	
	OJT participants were similar to the control group in terms of highest level of school completed.

	OJT participants were no more likely to have health insurance (in general or through an employer) than control group participants.  
	
	
	There were no significant differences between OJT participants and control participants in terms of the percent reporting they were in ""good, very good, or excellent health"", scores on the social support scale, or ratings of overall happiness.

In 2010, the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Labor made substantial investments in studying 8 subsidized employment interventions aimed at disadvantaged populations, including both Paid Work Experience (PWE) and On-the-Job Training (OJT) approaches for TANF recipients. This study focuses on programs in Los Angeles County, which has a large TANF program and a diverse context.  

This review focuses on the OJT intervention. OJT offers wage subsidies to for-profit employers who agree to place employees onto their payrolls after an initial two-month trial period, during which participants are paid by the South Bay Workforce Investment Board. If participants are shifted onto the employer's payroll, the employers receive a partial wage subsidy for each participant for up to an additional four months. This approach aims to simulate a ""real world"" work environment and hopes to move participants into long-term unsubsidized work with participating employers. The program serves TANF recipients who participated in Los Angeles County's welfare to-work program, but were unable to find unsubsidized jobs during a four-week job club.  ","The study's objective was to examine the impact of two approaches to subsidized employment for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients: Paid Work Experience (PWE) in the nonprofit or public sector, and On-the-Job Training (OJT) in for-profit companies.

In 2010, the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services and Labor made substantial investments in studying 8 subsidized employment interventions aimed at disadvantaged populations, including both Paid Work Experience (PWE) and On-the-Job Training (OJT) approaches for TANF recipients. This study focuses on programs in Los Angeles County, which has a large TANF program and a diverse population.  

This review focuses on both the PWE and OJT interventions. 

PWE fully subsidizes the wages of individuals placed at employers in the nonprofit or public sector for up to six months. The South Bay Workforce Investment Board serves as an intermediary between the TANF participant and the employer and pays participants the minimum wage. The goal of this model is to provide work experiences that will help the participants find an unsubsidized job. The model also includes 16 hours of paid job search near the end of placements and case management services to assist participants in their search for an unsubsidized job. 

OJT offers wage subsidies to for-profit employers who agree to place employees onto their payrolls after an initial two-month trial period, during which participants are paid by the South Bay Workforce Investment Board. If participants are shifted onto the employer's payroll, the employers receive a partial wage subsidy for each participant for up to an additional four months. This approach aims to simulate a ""real world"" work environment and hopes to move participants into long-term unsubsidized work with participating employers. ","The study's objective was to examine the impact of two approaches to subsidized employment for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients: Paid Work Experience (PWE) in the nonprofit or public sector, and On-the-Job Training (OJT) in for-profit companies. Many outcomes were evaluated in the domains of employment, earnings and wages, education and training, public benefit receipt, and health and safety.

"The study used a randomized controlled trial design. The researchers used a lottery-like process to randomly assign 2,622 individuals to one of three groups: the PWE program group (n=874), an OJT program group (n=877), or the control group (n=871). All participants were TANF recipients in Los Angeles County who participated in the county’s welfare-to-work program, but were unable to find unsubsidized jobs during a four-week job club. To be included, participants had to be receiving TANF benefits and have five or more months left of TANF eligibility, must not have participated in Transitional Subsidized Employment in the preceding 12 months, and must have been able to work the required hours and have no major identified barriers that would prevent them from working. 

Of the full sample, most (85.5%) of study participants were female, and more than 80% were non-White (55% Hispanic/Latino; 32% Black, non-Hispanic; 3% Asian, non-Hispanic). 39% of participants lacked a high school diploma or an equivalent credential. On average, participants were 31.7 years old.    

Participants assigned to the PWE group were referred to a Worksource Center to be placed into the corresponding type of subsidized job. Like those in the control group, they could continue to receive TANF benefits, as well as other TANF welfare-to-work services and community services. Of those randomized to the PWE group, 79 percent were placed in subsidized employment. On average, PWE placements were made in 24 days and lasted 149 days. Individuals in the control group were not placed into the subsidized job, but they could still receive TANF benefits, other TANF welfare-to-work services and community services.  

The impact analysis uses administrative data and survey data. Administrative data included quarterly wage data from the National Directory of New Hires and TANF and food stamp payment records from the Los Angeles Department of Public Social Services.  Survey data were collected from the full study sample at approximately 30 months after random assignment, including information about employment, education, training, and personal and economic well-being. The authors used a statistical model to compare the outcomes of those in PWE to those in the control group, accounting for initial characteristics.  ","Employment 


	
	PWE participants were more likely to have been employed during the first year of follow-up than control group participants (34.1 percentage points according to administrative data, 23.0 percentage points according to survey data), but no more likely to be employed during the last year of follow-up. However, among participants who were not employed in the year prior to enrollment, participants remained more likely to be employed in the last year of follow-up. 
	
	
	PWE participants were no more likely to be currently employed at the time of the 12-month or 30-month survey than control group members.  
	



	
	However, PWE participants were employed for 1.3 more quarters, on average, than control group participants during the first year of follow-up and 0.2 more quarters in the last year of follow-up, and were 8.2 percentage points more likely to work more than 34 hours per week at the time of the 30-month survey.  
	


Earnings and wages 


	
	Participants in the PWE program earned $2,716 more than those in the control group during the first year following enrollment, and $3,914 more in the total 30-month follow-up period.  
	
	
	PWE participants had a total income $2,189 more in the first year of follow-up than control group participants, but their total income was no greater in the last year of follow-up.  
	
	
	PWE participants were 5.6 percentage points more likely to have received income from working in the month prior to the 30-month survey, but were no more likely to be earning greater than $12.00 or greater than $15.00 per hour at that time. 
	


Education and skills gains 


	
	Compared to those in the control group, participants receiving PWE were no more likely to be participating in postsecondary education at the time of the 30-month survey.  
	
	
	PWE participants were similar to the control group in terms of highest level of school completed.  
	


Health and safety 


	
	PWE participants were 4.9 percentage points more likely to have health insurance coverage through their employer than control group participants, but no more likely to have health insurance in general.  
	



	
	There were no significant differences between PWE participants and control participants in terms of the percent reporting they were in """"good, very good, or excellent health"""", the percent experiencing serious psychological distress in the past month, scores on the social support scale, or ratings of overall happiness.  
	


Public benefits receipt 


	
	PWE participants received $464 less in TANF payments in the first year of follow-up compared to control group members, and $820 less during the total follow-up period, but received similar amounts from TANF during the last year of follow-up.  
	
	
	Similarly, PWE participants were 4.8 percentage points more likely to have left TANF in the year following enrollment, but effects were no longer significant for the 30-month follow-up period.  
	
	
	PWE participants were also 5.4 percentage points less likely to have received public assistance or welfare in the month prior to the 30-month survey as compared to control group members. However, there were no significant differences in terms of income received from food stamps or unemployment insurance, or the percent receiving the following: Supplemental Security Income, child support, childcare subsidies or vouchers, benefits from Section 8 or other housing assistance, food stamps, or Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefits. 
	


Training 


	
	Participants in the PWE program were no more likely than control group participants to be participating in vocational training or to have earned a professional license or certification at the time of the 30-month survey.  ","This profile describes multiple related impacts on outcomes related to: Employment; Earnings and wages; Education and skills gains; Training; Public benefit receipt; and Health and safety. Performing multiple statistical tests on related outcomes makes it more likely that some impacts will be found statistically significant purely by chance and not because they reflect program effectiveness. The findings presented do not include statistical adjustments to account for the multiple tests, so the number of statistically significant findings in these domains is likely to be overstated. 

The authors also point out at that placement rates for the PWE program differed across participating Worksource Centers. However, the authors were unable to study effects of the interventions at the individual center-level. For that reason, readers should recognize that the impacts of the PWE program may vary significantly depending on the operational context in which it is delivered.  

Authors also note that the composite income measure was unlikely to have captured all income received by individuals and did not include other household members' income. For those reasons, it likely underestimated the true total incomes of participants. ",,,,"Absence of conflict of interest.

"This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of the FSS program in improving individuals’ and households’ economic well-being. The study was a randomized controlled trial. Individuals were considered eligible for the study if they, as head of household, were receiving assistance under the federal HCV program, were in good standing with the housing authority, and were new to the FSS program. A total of 2,656 eligible households were randomly assigned to the treatment or the control group (exact breakdowns by group are unknown). Those assigned to the treatment group completed a Contract of Participation and became eligible to participate in the FSS program and build escrow. Those in the control group received information about resources and other services in the community but were not eligible to participate in the FSS program for three years after study enrollment. The analysis sample consisted of 2,556 households (1,285 treatment and 1,271 control). The sample was predominantly female (91%). Nearly three-quarters of the sample identified as Black or African American, and slightly more than half were employed at the time of enrollment.  

The primary data sources for the study included administrative data from HUD, a survey administered 18 months after the study began, and quarterly wage data from the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) for two quarters prior to and eight quarters after random assignment. The authors used a statistical model to compare the outcomes of treatment and control group members. The model controlled for differences in sample member characteristics at the time of random assignment.  ","Employment


	
	The study found that FSS program participants were less likely than control group members to be employed in all quarters in the two years following program enrollment (38 percent of the treatment group employed in all quarters vs. 41 percent of the control group). The study did not find any other significant differences in employment outcomes between FSS program participants and the control group.

	The study found no statistically significant relationship between the FSS program and the share of households that received food stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), or other public benefits, nor between the FSS program and participants’ continued enrollment in the HCV program. ","The study randomly assigned 2,656 HCV recipients but excluded from the analysis sample households that voluntarily withdrew from the study, were determined to be ineligible, or were headed by elderly individuals. Because information on how many individuals were originally assigned to the treatment versus control group is not available, sample attrition cannot be calculated. Therefore, the study is not eligible for a high causal evidence rating, the highest rating available. However, the study does demonstrate that the two groups were equivalent before program participation on a range of important baseline characteristics and does control for sample members’ characteristics at the time of random assignment, and, therefore, study analyses that are based on the full impact study sample are eligible for a moderate causal evidence rating. Outcomes assessed using survey data are only available for about 60 percent of the impact sample which could have created differences between the treatment and comparison groups. Consequently, comparisons of outcomes based on survey data receive a low rating. ",,"To represent a variety of contexts within which FSS programs operate, the study included FSS programs operated by 18 housing authorities in seven states. ",,"Absence of conflict of interest. ",,"United States","Causal Impact Analysis","Adult, Low income","Employment and Training Services, Training and Education, Other training and education","Earnings and wages-Mod/high-No impacts, Employment-Mod/high-Mixed impacts, Public benefits receipt-Mod/high-No impacts","Earnings and wages, Employment, Public benefits receipt","Introduced in 1990, the FSS program is one of the main federal strategies to support employment and foster financial security for recipients of housing choice vouchers (HCV).

"The study uses two different study designs: 1) a matched difference-in-differences study design to analyze the claim rate ratio, lost-time claim rate ratio, and costs paid rate ratio for the RC serviced employers compared to the non-serviced employers before and after service provision, and 2) a time-trend adjusted regression model among employers who ever received a RC visit. In design 1, each employer was matched to another employer who was non-serviced and had a similar number of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, 3-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry code, and loss history. In design 2, authors analyzed quarter-to-quarter changes during the before period, intervention period, and subsequent after periods. In the matched study design, the sample included 4,178 matched pairs of employers (n=8,356). In the time-trend analysis, the sample included 4,606 employers that did not receive RC services through a Safety Intervention Grant (SIG) or participate Safety Council (SC) before 2006; had 10 or more FTE employees; completed NAICS industry information; did not have outlier employee counts and rates; and had sufficient data before the first RC visit. The primary data source was the OHBWC database that included measures of employer level claims and policy information on who also had systematic centralized RC information 2006-2017.

"The authors used matching and a difference-in-difference-in-difference design to examine the impact of the Seattle Minimum Wage Ordinance on employment, earnings, and wages. The study used administrative employment microdata from Washington's Employment Security Department (ESD), which collects quarterly payroll records for all workers covered by unemployment insurance in Washington. Employers are required to report actual hours worked for employees paid by the hour and either actual hours worked or 40 times the number of weeks worked for salaried employees. The treatment group included people who worked for Seattle businesses for wages less than $11 per hour in the first calendar quarter of 2015 (baseline quarter). The comparison group included workers employed in low-wage jobs in Washington State outside of King County at baseline. The authors used a nearest-neighbor matching strategy to match treatment and comparison group members. Individuals were matched based on quarterly hours worked in the baseline period, hourly wages in the baseline period, number of employers in a quarter, number of quarters working with their current primary employer, and the number of quarters since they first appeared in Washington State data. To account for differences in labor market conditions between the treatment and matched comparison group, the authors examined the impact of a pseudo-minimum-wage ordinance on pre-policy data. The pseudo-treatment group included workers from the first quarter of 2012 who earned less than $11 per hour and worked entirely for firms in Seattle. The authors matched them with pseudo-comparison workers from Washington State outside King County during the same period. The authors tracked both groups for six quarters and estimated a difference-in-difference effect using the same methodology. Finally, the authors presented a difference-in-difference-in-difference estimator equal to the difference between the true difference-in-difference estimate and the pseudo-difference-in-difference estimate computed for the 2012 cohort.","Earnings and wagesThe study suggested that the Seattle Minimum Wage Ordinance was associated with higher wages and quarterly earnings.EmploymentThe study suggested that the Seattle Minimum Wage Ordinance was associated with lower hours worked per quarter. The study suggested that the Seattle Minimum Wage Ordinance was not associated with employment.   ","The authors tested possible anticipatory effects of the policy and found that they were small.",,,,"Absence of conflict of interest.",,"Rural, United States","Causal Impact Analysis","Employed, Low income","Compensation and Workplace Conditions, Wages and Benefits, Minimum wage","Earnings and wages-Low-Favorable impacts, Employment-Low-Unfavorable impacts",,"In June 2014, Seattle, Washington passed a minimum-wage ordinance phasing an increase to $15 per hour with inflation indexing.

The study followed two cohorts of participants (cohort 1: 2016-2017 and cohort 2: 2017-2018) for two tick seasons (March through December). To be eligible for the study, participants were required to be at least 18 years old, work outside for at least an average of 10 hours each week during the peak of tick season, and provide written informed consent. People were excluded from the study if they were pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study, were unable to speak English, or knew they were allergic or sensitive to insecticides. Of the 132 eligible participants, 65 were randomly assigned to the treatment group and 67 were randomly assigned to the control group.  At the start of each season participants were told to put their study ID on their work clothing and ship them to be treated. The treatment group participants were sent back clothing that was treated with permethrin and the control group participants were sent back clothing that was washed and dried. All participants were instructed to follow their normal tick bite prevention methods and to wash their clothing as usual. Participants were also required to complete weekly online tick bite logs. The authors removed participants from the study if they did not send in the clothing or did not maintain the tick bite logs.

"The United States does not provide universal access to paid sick leave; however, some U.S. cities have sick leave mandates. The authors studied sick leave mandates in nine cities (San Francisco, CA; Washington, DC; Seattle, WA; New York, NY; Portland, OR; Jersey City, NJ; Newark, NJ; Philadelphia, PA; and Oakland, CA). The dates the laws went into effect ranged from 2007 to 2015, and the details of each law vary. All sick leave pay mandates were employer mandates, with criteria for sick pay dependent on the overall number of employees, number of full-time employees, number of days worked to accrue leave, and type of job sector. Each mandate provided sick time for personal use or for a sick family member. Typically, employees earn one hour of paid sick leave per work week and up to seven days per year. Most mandates require a 90-day working period to accrue the sick pay benefit.  The authors used a difference-in-differences design to examine how employment and wages changed in areas with and without sick pay mandates. The treatment groups consisted of counties or regions within nine cities with sick pay mandates. The authors created comparison groups for each treatment group comprised of other counties with identical pre-sick pay mandate outcomes, similar labor markets, and similar population structures. The authors obtained private sector employment and wage data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The data included all jobs covered by Unemployment Insurance and included the number of jobs filled each month and average weekly wages by quarter. The authors used statistical models to compare the outcomes between the groups 48 months before and 36 months after the law went into effect.  ","EmploymentThe study did not find any significant differences in employment between the treatment and comparison groups. Earnings and wagesThe study did not find significant differences in wages between the treatment and comparison groups. ","In San Francisco, two laws went into effect in January 2008 that could potentially confound an assessment of the sick pay mandate. First, the minimum wage was increased in predetermined steps annually from $8.50 in 2004 to $9.79 in 2009. Second, the Health Care Security Ordinance set minimum rates for employee health care spending by employers (those vary by firm size and for-profit status). In Washington, DC the first mandate became effective shortly after the Great Recession hit in October 2008. This makes it challenging to disentangle labor market effects due to the mandate from the confounding effects of the Great Recession. Therefore, the studies of the San Francisco and Washington, DC sites are not eligible for a moderate causal evidence rating, the highest rating available for nonexperimental designs. ",,,,"Absence of conflict of interest",,"Rural, United States",,Employed,"Compensation and Workplace Conditions, Wages and Benefits, Paid leave","Earnings and wages-Mod/high-No impacts, Employment-Mod/high-No impacts","Earnings and wages, Employment",,"The study's objective was to examine the impact of sick leave mandates on employment and wages.

Researchers recruited volunteers for the study from a faculty meeting at the participating school in advance of enrollment. A total of 24 faculty from one school (18 teachers, 4 guidance counselors, 1 principal, and 1 school psychologist) participated in the study. Interested participants provided baseline data and then were randomly assigned to the intervention group or the control group. The author assigned 12 faculty to the treatment condition (mindfulness-based intervention) and 12 faculty to the waitlist control group (could enter the mindfulness class after data collection). The majority of the study sample was female (95.8%) and White (91.7%), with an average age of 42.8. Half of participants reported previous receipt of mental health services.

"This study was a randomized controlled trial in New York City public schools. The study sample were 9th grade cohorts of students offered admission between 2013 and 2017. Using the NYC high school lottery system, the treatment sample were students who gained admission to one of the seven P-TECH 9-14 schools via lottery (i.e., they were not in a priority category). The control sample were students who expressed interest in P-TECH schools but were admitted to another school (one of 399 other high schools across New York City) based on the lottery process. The total study sample was 3,161 students, with 1,479 in the treatment group and 1,682 in the control group. Less than half of the student sample were female (42%), and the majority were racially and ethnically diverse (46% Hispanic and 42% Black).

"This study used a difference-in-differences approach to examine the impact of Arkansas’s Medicaid work requirement policy on public benefits receipt, employer benefits receipt, and employment. Arkansas fully implemented the work requirement policy beginning in June 2018 and ending in April 2019. The Arkansas policy required Medicaid recipients (aged 30-49) to work 20 hours per week, engage in an equivalent amount of community activities, or submit an exception. To compare the differences in outcomes, study authors used states with similar economic and demographic profiles that did not implement the same work requirement policy as Arkansas during the time period; this included Louisiana, Texas, and Kentucky. Data were collected in 2016, 2018, and 2019 using telephone surveys. Low-income adults in the target age group were over sampled. The total sample included 8,661 Medicaid recipients, with 60 percent from Arkansas. Participants were asked to provide retrospective data to estimate employment status prior to the policy implementation. The authors used statistical models to examine if changes in employment and insurance coverage in Arkansas during the period of the policy were greater than the changes in the comparison states. The models controlled for sex, race, language, marital status, type of residence, and year.  ","Public benefits receiptThe study found a significant relationship between work requirements for Medicaid recipients and a reduction in Medicaid coverage. Employer benefits receiptThe study did not find a significant relationship between work requirements for Medicaid recipients and employer benefits receipt.  Employment The study also did not find a significant relationship between work requirements for Medicaid recipients and employment.  ","Because the analysis considered a policy operating in only one state, it is impossible to disentangle the effect of Arkansas’s Medicaid work requirement policy from the effect of the state itself; this is known as a confounding factor.

We cannot attribute the estimated effects with confidence to Arkansas’s Medicaid work requirement policy, and not to other factors.

"The study used a nonexperimental design to examine the efficacy of text messages to reinforce ergonomics knowledge and behaviors. The sample included 119 masonry apprentices who participated in a randomized controlled trial and received SAVE ergonomics training. Of the 119 participants, 54 participants completed SAVE ergonomics training only (Ergonomics) and 65 participants completed both SAVE ergonomics training and SAVE training on using safety voice (Ergonomics + Safety Voice). The majority of the sample was male (97%), with larger percentages of White participants (60%) than African American/Black (20%) or Latino/Hispanic (16%). The average age of participants was 28.8 and less than half of the participants (48%) graduated from high school.  For six months after SAVE training, the authors sent participants text messages to reinforce the knowledge and skills they learned. The participants received more frequent texts in the first month, with the number of text messages decreasing gradually in later months. There were 40 texts about ergonomics and 28 texts about safety voice. Half of the text messages included questions about knowledge or behavior and requested a response. The other half provided a reminder about the training with no request for response. Ergonomics participants received the 40 texts about ergonomics whereas Ergonomics + Safety Voice participants received both (a total of 68 text messages). The authors conducted statistical tests using the text message responses to assess group differences in ergonomics knowledge and behavior.  ","Health and safety The study did not find significant differences in correct responses to ergonomics knowledge texts between Ergonomics participants and Ergonomics + Safety Voice participants.  However, the study found that Ergonomics participants reported significantly greater consideration of safe ways to manage lifting than Ergonomics + Safety Voice participants (100% vs. 80%).  ","The authors did not account for preexisting differences between the groups in ergonomics knowledge or behaviors before the start of the text messages. These preexisting differences between the groups—and not the text messages—could explain the observed differences in outcomes. Also, the authors noted that the response rates to the text messages was higher among Ergonomics participants than the Ergonomics + Safety Voice participants. The two groups received a different amount of text messages, with the Ergonomics + Safety Voice group receiving more study text messages which may have impacted their lower response rate and could explain the differences in responses.

"The study used a difference-in-differences design to estimate the impacts of ACA Medicaid expansion on health insurance coverage and other outcomes for documented farm workers.   The study used individual worker data from the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS), a nationally representative survey of hired crop workers. The NAWS uses a repeated independent annual cross-section design to sample documented farm workers. Workers sampled for the NAWS were surveyed three times a year through face-to-face interviews. The study analyzed data from 2007 through 2016, before and after the ACA Medicaid expansions in 2014. The study sample included 9,950 documented farm workers in the United States. One quarter of the workers were female, 53.4% were married, and 44.9% were foreign-born. The average age of farm workers was about 38 years old. On average, the sample received 9.4 years of schooling and the annual family income was $27,443. The treatment group consisted of documented farm workers in states that implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion in 2014. The comparison group consisted of documented farm workers in states that did not implement the ACA Medicaid expansion in 2014 as well as documented farm workers in a few states that expanded in 2014 but had already implemented a prior comprehensive Medicaid expansion.  The authors used a statistical model to compare health insurance coverage over time for documented farm workers in states that did and did not expand Medicaid in 2014. The analysis used a difference-in-differences model that included state-fixed effects and year-fixed effects and controlled for select individual-level demographic and employment characteristics.","Public Benefits ReceiptStudy findings suggested that states that expanded Medicaid in 2014 experienced larger increases in overall health insurance coverage among documented farm workers than states that did not expand Medicaid.  Study findings suggested that states that expanded Medicaid in 2014 experienced larger increases in government-sponsored health insurance coverage among documented farm workers than states that did not expand Medicaid.  Study findings provided some evidence that Medicaid expansion was associated with increases in the receipt of other public benefits. States that expanded Medicaid in 2014 experienced larger increases in the share of documented workers who reported receiving TANF benefits. However, there was no evidence of a statistically significant association between Medicaid expansion and SNAP receipt, WIC receipt, or housing assistance receipt.   Employer Benefits ReceiptThere was no evidence of a statistically significant relationship between Medicaid expansion and employer-provided health insurance coverage among documented farm workers.Employment Study findings suggested that, on average, documented farm workers in states that expanded Medicaid increased their weekly hours more than farm workers in states that did not expand Medicaid.  Study findings suggested that rates of non-farm employment among documented farm workers decreased by more in states that expanded Medicaid than in states that did not expand Medicaid.  Earnings and Wages  There was no evidence of a statistically significant relationship between Medicaid expansion and earnings or wages for documented farm workers.","The authors’ difference-in-differences regression model included controls for a number of individual characteristics to adjust for possible pre-existing or time-varying demographic differences between the treatment and comparison groups. However, the regression model used to estimate the impacts of Medicaid expansion did not adjust for the race or ethnicity of documented farm workers. To receive a moderate evidence rating – the highest available evidence rating for quasi-experimental studies using difference-in-differences designs – CLEAR requires the use of specific control variables, including race and ethnicity. In this case, preexisting or time-varying differences in the racial or ethnic composition of documented farm workers – and not the ACA Medicaid expansion – could explain the observed differences in outcomes. Therefore, the study is not eligible for a moderate causal evidence rating, the highest rating available for nonexperimental designs.",,,,"Absence of conflict of interest.",,"United States","Causal Impact Analysis","Adult, Employed","Compensation and Workplace Conditions, Wages and Benefits, Health insurance","Earnings and wages-Low-No impacts, Employer benefits receipt-Low-No impacts, Employment-Low-Favorable impacts, Public benefits receipt-Low-Favorable impacts",,"As enacted in 2010, the ACA included provisions that would expand Medicaid eligibility to all adults with incomes within 138% of the federal poverty level, beginning in 2014. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of the ACA Medicaid expansion and continue to use pre-existing Medicaid eligibility requirements. Approximately half of all states opted to expand Medicaid eligibility in 2014. Several additional states opted to expand Medicaid eligibility in subsequent years.  Prior to the ACA, Medicaid eligibility was more restrictive, with individuals needing to meet more restrictive means testing and belong to a Medicaid-eligible demographic group, such as parents or individuals with disabilities.","The study's objective was to examine the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion among documented agricultural workers on health insurance coverage; employer-paid health insurance coverage; government-sponsored health insurance coverage; employment; and public benefits receipt. The authors used a difference-in-differences design to estimate the impacts of ACA Medicaid expansion on health insurance coverage and other outcomes using individual worker data from the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS), a nationally representative survey of hired crop workers that includes information about the demographic, employment, and health characteristics of these workers. The authors used a statistical model to compare health insurance coverage and other outcomes over time for documented farm workers in states that did and did not expand Medicaid in 2014.  The study’s findings suggested that Medicaid expansion was associated with higher rates of health insurance coverage among documented farm workers. This study receives a low evidence rating. This means we are not confident that the estimated effects are attributable to Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion; other factors are likely to have contributed.","Kandilov, A. M.

"The SSWell study used a randomized design that assigned 97 businesses to either the treatment or the waitlist control condition. For these 97 businesses, 2,785 employees completed a baseline employee survey. This sample included all small businesses in Colorado that already participated in Health Links. Two thirds of the businesses (66/97) were assigned to the treatment condition, which consisted of Health Links plus the TWH leadership program. The remaining one third of businesses (31/97) were assigned to the waitlist control, participating in just Health Links in year one of their participation and Health Links plus the TWH leadership program in year two. The study included two analytic samples: a sample of businesses and a sample of employees. To be included in the final analytic sample of businesses, businesses needed to participate in the baseline, year one, and year two assessments, and needed to have at least one employee complete their year one and year two employee survey. Based on these criteria, the final analysis sample included 36 out of the initial 97 businesses. To be included in the analytic sample of employees, employees needed to complete the first- and second-year employee surveys while employed at the same business. Based on these criteria, the final sample included 250 out of the initial 2,785 employees. For the analysis, the treatment group included 13 businesses (and their employees) that received the intervention in year one (including one that was part of the original randomly selected control group). The control group included 23 businesses that were initially waitlisted and then received the intervention in year two (including nine that were originally randomly selected to receive the intervention in year one). On average, the final sample of businesses had around 110 employees and an average baseline TWH score of 46. The final sample of employees were on average 42 years old, majority white (87%), and had been at their current job for five years.   Data were collected via an online business assessment at baseline and after one year, and via online employee surveys at baseline, one year, and two year follow ups.  The business assessment instrument, the Healthy Workplace Assessment, measures TWH policies across six benchmarks and gives organizations a score between 0 and 97. The questions in the employee survey were developed by the study authors and consisted of questions surrounding a) safety leadership and b) health leadership.  The employee survey included five secondary outcomes: 1) safety climate 2) health climate, 3) safety behavior, 4) health behavior, and 5) wellbeing. Employee surveys were distributed through a primary contact at each business.","Health and Safety The study found no relationship between a business’s participation in the TWH leadership program and the TWH policies and programs score. The study also found no relationship between a business’s participation in the TWH leadership program and employees’ ratings of safety or health leadership.","The composition of the treatment and control groups in the analytic samples was not truly random because the authors included in the control group businesses (and their employees) that were assigned to treatment but did not participate in the intervention. Therefore, some businesses included in the control group are likely to be different from businesses in the treatment group because of the characteristics related to those businesses’ decision not to participate. Additionally, business and employee attrition from the original samples was high. Due to this high attrition, the study had poor statistical precision.",,,,"Absence of conflict of interest.","Small business","United States","Causal Impact Analysis","Adult, Employed","Compensation and Workplace Conditions, Health and Safety, Health, Safety","Health and safety-Low-No impacts",,"Total Worker Health (TWH) is a concept defined by the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as ‘‘policies, programs, and practices that integrate protection from work-related safety and health hazards with promotion of injury and illness prevention efforts to advance worker well-being.’’ The intervention in this study consisted of participation in the usual-practice TWH program called Health Links® with the addition of a TWH leadership development program. The program is implemented with business leaders and encourages them to assess their current practices and culture surrounding TWH and use their position in leadership to improve policies and change company culture as needed. The program serves small businesses, defined as businesses with fewer than 500 employees.","The Small + Safe + Well (SSWell) study's objective was to examine the impact of participation in a Total Worker Health® (TWH) leadership development program on small business health and safety outcomes.  The study used a randomized design that assigned businesses either to a TWH leadership program or to the waitlist control condition. Both treatment and control businesses were participating in Health Links®, a program to help businesses develop TWH policies and programs. Data was collected one year after enrollment via an assessment of business policies and programs and employee surveys on perceptions of safety and health leadership. The study analyzed whether businesses that were in the treatment condition had higher rated business policies related to TWH, and higher employee ratings of safety and health leadership.  The study found no relationship between participation in the TWH leadership program and any of the primary outcomes, including businesses' TWH policies and programs score, employees’ ratings of safety leadership, or employees’ ratings of health leadership.  The quality of causal evidence presented in this study is low because of compromised randomization and high levels of attrition. For analytic purposes, businesses (and their employees) that were randomly assigned to treatment but did not participate in the intervention were included in the control group, which compromises the randomization.

"The study used a randomized controlled trial to examine the impacts of Paycheck Plus on earnings and employment. Participants were randomly assigned to either a treatment group eligible for Paycheck Plus or a control group not eligible for Paycheck Plus but eligible for existing tax credits. Participants were followed for three years, starting in the 2017 tax season and running through 2019.  The study recruited 4,000 participants in the Atlanta, Georgia metro area. To be eligible, participants had to be unmarried, have a valid Social Security Number (SSN), be aged 21 to 64, have earned less than $30,000 in the previous year, have no dependent children to claim on their taxes, and were not receiving or applying for Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Insurance. Most participants were Non-Hispanic Black (86%). About six in ten were male (61%) and were older than 35 (60%). Most participants had at least a high school diploma (86%), and most were paid less than $18,000 in the previous year (80%). About four in ten were noncustodial parents.  Data sources included a baseline survey, Georgia Department of Labor unemployment insurance wage records, Internal Revenue Service tax records, and Georgia Department of Human Services Division of Child Support Services child support records.

Due to their dispersed geographical location across multiple counties, participants faced longer travel distances and fewer public transportation options for claiming their Paycheck Plus bonus payments in person, which was a program requirement. Additionally, they had fewer connections to the tax system and free tax preparation since the United Way of Greater Atlanta, the program’s implementation partner, was less well-known than its New York counterpart as a tax assistance provider. (The demonstration was also run in New York City from 2014 through 2017.)

"The study was a randomized controlled trial that compared the employment and earnings outcomes of job trainees who were assigned to receive the Career Pathways training and those assigned to a comparison group. The study analyzes data from 20 cohorts of job trainees, comprising 197 individuals who were randomly assigned to the treatment group and 192 individuals who were randomly assigned to the comparison group. An additional 28 individuals who underwent random assignment (and who were assigned evenly across the two groups) could not be matched to employment records and were excluded from the analytic sample.  Individuals assigned to the comparison group could still receive additional employment training and support outside of the Career Pathways intervention. Additionally, individuals initially assigned to the comparison group could re-enter the randomization pool in subsequent cohorts, and some of these individuals were later assigned to receive the Career Pathways intervention. To guard against possible self-selection into multiple cohorts, all individuals were analyzed based on their initial random assignment status using an intent-to-treat framework. Just over half of study participants were male and the average age of study participants was about 40 years old. Approximately 60 percent of the sample had earned at least $5,000 in the previous year. About 90 percent of study participants identified as Black. Approximately half of the sample was employed at baseline, and the other half of the sample was unemployed at baseline (close to 30 percent experienced a spell of short-term unemployment and close to 20 percent experienced a spell of long-term unemployment).  The primary data sources for the analysis were a baseline survey of study participants and quarterly employment and earning records from the Louisiana Workforce Commission (LWC) for the period spanning the first quarter of 2014 through the first quarter of 2019. The baseline survey gathered data on employment, earnings, and demographic information. The authors used a statistical model to compare the outcomes of treatment and comparison group members. The authors also conducted a subgroup analysis that examined whether intervention impacts varied depending on the employment status of study participants at baseline (e.g., employed at baseline vs. short-term unemployed at baseline vs. long-term unemployed at baseline).","Employment A pooled analysis of all participants (regardless of employment status at baseline) did not detect a statistically significant association between assignment to the Career Pathways intervention and rates of post-intervention employment. EarningsA pooled analysis of all participants (regardless of employment status at baseline) did not detect a statistically significant association between assignment to the Career Pathways intervention and average post-intervention earnings.","Additional subgroup analyses by baseline employment status suggested that assignment to the Career Pathways intervention had a favorable and statistically significant impact on earnings for individuals who were unemployed at baseline, but not for individuals who were already employed at baseline.   The authors report that many individuals assigned to the Career Pathways intervention did not ultimately complete all of the intervention trainings. Additionally, given the study’s design, some individuals assigned to the comparison group did receive some or all of the Career Pathways intervention. Relatively low rates of treatment group take-up and relatively high rates of comparison group crossover might make it more difficult to measure the impact of the Career Pathways intervention, if any exists. To address this issue, the authors also estimate local average treatment effects (LATE) in an attempt to measure the impact of receiving Career Pathways training that is attributable to random assignment status.
